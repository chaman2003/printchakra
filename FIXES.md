# 🔧 Quick Fix - WebSocket & Upload Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket.IO Broadcast Error
**Error:** `Server.emit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'broadcast'`

**Fix:** Removed `broadcast=True` parameter from all `socketio.emit()` calls. Flask-SocketIO 5.3.5 broadcasts by default from server-side emit.

### 2. Upload Disconnection Issues
**Error:** Server disconnecting during uploads

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Improved logging at each step of upload process
- Made Socket.IO emit non-critical (won't fail upload if emit fails)
- Added detailed console output for debugging

### 3. CORS Configuration
**Fix:** Added `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to allowed origins

### 4. Socket.IO Configuration
**Improvements:**
- Set `async_mode='threading'` for better performance
- Disabled verbose logging (logger=False, engineio_logger=False)
- Increased timeouts (ping_timeout=60, ping_interval=25)

## 🚀 Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart Backend
```powershell
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
.\backend.ps1
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
```
Press F12 > Application > Clear Storage > Clear site data
```

### 3. Test Upload Flow
1. Go to Phone page: http://localhost:3000/phone
2. Upload an image
3. Check terminal for detailed logs:
   ```
   Processing upload: doc_20251012_225538_6af9a9b9.jpg
   File saved to: C:\...\backend\uploads\doc_...jpg
   Starting image processing...
   Image processed successfully. Text length: 123
   Text saved to: C:\...\backend\processed_text\...txt
   Socket.IO notification sent
   ```

### 4. Verify WebSocket Connection
- Dashboard should show green "Connected to server" indicator
- Phone page should show green "Connected to server" indicator

## 📊 Understanding the Logs

**Normal Upload Flow:**
```
Client connected: <socket-id>
Processing upload: doc_<timestamp>_<uuid>.jpg
File saved to: <path>
Starting image processing...
Image processed successfully. Text length: <number>
Text saved to: <path>
Socket.IO notification sent
127.0.0.1 - - [12/Oct/2025 22:57:19] "POST /upload HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

**Error Indicators:**
- `"POST /upload HTTP/1.1" 500 -` = Server error (check logs above)
- `Upload error: <message>` = Specific error details
- `Client disconnected` immediately after upload = Connection issue

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Check These:
1. **Backend terminal shows errors?**
   - Read error message carefully
   - Check if Tesseract is installed
   - Verify all directories exist

2. **Browser console shows errors?**
   - F12 > Console tab
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

3. **File not appearing in Dashboard?**
   - Manually refresh (🔄 button)
   - Check backend/processed/ folder
   - Verify Socket.IO is connected

### Common Solutions:

**Port already in use:**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**Upload fails with 400 error:**
- Check file format (jpg, png, jpeg only)
- Verify file size (not too large)
- Try different image

**Socket.IO not connecting:**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify backend is running
- Try different browser

**OCR not working:**
- Install Tesseract: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Add to PATH or update app.py line 42

## 📝 Detailed Logging Enabled

Now you'll see helpful logs like:
- ✅ File upload progress
- ✅ Image processing status
- ✅ OCR text extraction length
- ✅ Socket.IO notification status
- ✅ Error stack traces

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **Upload Image** → Terminal shows processing steps
2. **Image Processed** → File appears in Dashboard
3. **Socket.IO Notifies** → Dashboard auto-refreshes
4. **No Disconnections** → Stays connected throughout

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

Check the terminal output and look for:
```
Upload error: <specific error message>
```

The detailed logs will show exactly where the process fails.
