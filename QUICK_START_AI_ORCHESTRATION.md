"Hey, scan this document"
"Hey, scan at 600 DPI in color"
"Hey, scan high quality as PDF"
"Hey, capture document with text mode"
```

### 3. AI Response
AI will say: **"Ready to [action]. Shall we proceed?"**

### 4. Confirm
Say: **"Yes"** / **"Proceed"** / **"Go ahead"**

### 5. Orchestration Opens
- Modal opens automatically
