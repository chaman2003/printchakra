## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Text Input Not Visible
**Problem**: Can't see text input field
**Solution**: 
- Click the "Voice Control" header to expand
- Panel should show mic button AND text input

### Issue 2: Send Button Disabled
**Problem**: Can't click send button
**Solution**:
- Make sure you typed something (not empty)
- Wait if processing previous command
- Check for any errors in browser console (F12)

### Issue 3: Command Not Recognized
**Problem**: Typed command but nothing happens
**Solution**:
- Check exact phrasing in "💡 Available Commands" section
- Try simpler phrasing: "select document" not "please select a document"
- Check toast notification for hints

### Issue 4: Voice Recording Fails
**Problem**: Mic button doesn't work
**Solution**:
- Allow microphone permissions in browser
- Try text input instead for testing
- Check backend is running: `python app.py`

### Issue 5: Modal Not Scrolling
**Problem**: "scroll down" doesn't work
**Solution**:
- Make sure there's content to scroll (expand some sections first)
- Try "scroll up" then "scroll down" again
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue 6: Toast Notifications Not Showing
**Problem**: No feedback after command
**Solution**:
- Command might still be working (check settings changed)
- Look at "YOU SAID" and "AI" boxes in voice panel
- Check browser console (F12) for logs

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Enable Console Logging
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for these messages:

🎤 Voice command received: SELECT_DOCUMENT
✅ Opening document selector
🎨 Color Mode: color
```

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# In backend terminal, look for:
🔍 Processing message: 'select document' | Pending orchestration: None
✅ Voice processing complete
```

### Verify State Changes
```javascript
// After command, check if:
1. Setting actually changed (look at UI)
2. Toast appeared
3. Modal scrolled (if scroll command)
4. Step changed (if apply/back command)
```

## 🎯 Priority Test Order

**Start with these (easiest to verify):**

1. ✅ Type "select document" → Should open selector immediately
2. ✅ Type "scroll down" → Should see scrolling animation
3. ✅ Type "color" → Should see toast notification
4. ✅ Type "landscape" → Should see layout change + toast

**Then test workflow:**

5. ✅ Type "apply settings" → Should advance to step 3
6. ✅ Type "go back" → Should return to step 2
7. ✅ Type "cancel" → Should close modal

**Finally test voice (if text works):**

8. 🎤 Say "select document" → Should work like text
