PrintChakra — Post-release Future Work

This file lists the recommended post-release activities (concrete engineering and operational tasks) followed by a separate long-term Future Scope section for larger research or product expansion ideas.

Future Work (post-release)
--------------------------
These items are practical, actionable tasks to stabilize the released product, improve reliability, and add quality-of-life features for users and operators.

- Logging & observability
  - Add structured logging (JSON) and rotate logs. Capture key events: uploads, processing duration, errors.
  - Add a lightweight metrics endpoint and integrate with a simple Prometheus scrape job (or a hosted metrics provider).

- Reliability & monitoring
  - Add readiness and liveness endpoints for the backend and a small status page in the Dashboard.
  - Add alerts (email/Slack) for repeated processing failures or storage exhaustion.

- Security & hardening
  - Add file size and mime-type validation, basic content scanning, and rate limits for upload endpoints.
  - Require authentication for any public-facing tunnel; add an API key or JWT gating for ngrok/proxy access.

- Backup & retention
  - Implement a retention policy (e.g., auto-delete after configurable days) and an on-demand export of processed data.
  - Add optional backups to S3-compatible storage with lifecycle rules.

- UX polish and QA
  - Improve phone UI: clearer upload progress, retry options, and inline error messages.
  - Add a small E2E smoke test that uploads a sample image and verifies pipeline success.

- Printer utilities
  - Keep the "Test Printer" feature in the Dashboard to create a printable blank PDF and report status.
  - Add logging for print attempts and a manual reprint option.

Future Scope (long-term)
------------------------
These are bigger product directions, suitable for roadmap items, research, or potential premium features.

- Cloud & SaaS readiness
  - Rework storage to support multi-tenant S3 buckets, tenant isolation, and per-tenant quotas.
  - Offer hosted deployments with self-service signup and team management.

- Background processing & scaling
  - Move heavy image/OCR processing to background workers (Celery/RQ) with Redis and autoscaling workers.
  - Add observability per task (latency, retries, failure rate).

- Document intelligence
  - Add document classification and structured extraction (invoices, receipts, forms). Provide export adapters (CSV, JSON, integrations).
  - Provide configurable workflows: when X detected → run Y → notify Z.

- Edge & mobile enhancements
  - Optimize preprocessing for edge inference (OpenVINO, TensorRT) and provide a lightweight on-device agent.
  - Ship a PWA or minimal mobile app with offline capture and sync.

- Ecosystem & integrations
  - Provide connectors: Google Drive, Dropbox, Slack, Zapier, and accounting systems for automated flows.

Final notes
-----------
Focus first on post-release stabilization and observability. After the product is stable, prioritize background processing and document intelligence work for measurable user value.
