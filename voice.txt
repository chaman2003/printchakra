PrintChakra Voice Workflow (Printing & Scanning)
===============================================

Printing Flow
-------------
1. User command: "Print [copies] copies [color/bw] [simplex/duplex]" (e.g., "Print 3 copies in color, double sided").
2. Browser streams audio to backend Whisper (continuous listening, silence detection).
3. Whisper transcribes speech (<1 s) and passes text to AI Orchestrator (Smollm2).
4. Orchestrator extracts intent=PRINT plus parameters: copies, color mode, layout, duplex, page range.
5. Socket.IO event `orchestration_update` pre-configures print UI and confirms settings aloud.
6. User says "Confirm print" or "Adjust [setting]".
7. On confirmation, backend triggers `execute_print` with selected file, printer profile, and settings.
8. Status events (`processing_progress`, `print_complete`) stream back for voice acknowledgment.

Scanning Flow
-------------
1. User command: "Scan [resolution] at [DPI] to [format]" (e.g., "Scan this at 600 DPI to searchable PDF").
2. Audio pipeline identical to printing: continuous capture → Whisper transcription → AI Orchestrator.
3. Orchestrator detects intent=SCAN plus parameters: DPI, color mode, destination format, multi-page flag.
4. Socket.IO pushes `capture_now` or `scan_prepare` to initiate scanner module with parsed settings.
5. User can say "Add another page" or "Finish scanning" to control multi-page workflow.
6. Final command "Save scan" or "Send to email" triggers export service (PDF, DOCX, image bundle).
7. Completion confirmation spoken back; links provided via UI and `conversion_complete` event.

Global Voice Controls
---------------------
- "Cancel" → abort current print/scan action.
- "Help" → list available voice templates.
- "Status" → query current job progress.
- "Repeat settings" → re-read the interpreted configuration before confirmation.

Example Voice Session (Print → Scan)
------------------------------------
1. User says, "Print three copies in color, double sided." Browser streams audio, Whisper transcribes, and the orchestrator emits `orchestration_update` summarizing: copies=3, color=color, duplex=long-edge.
2. System responds, "Ready to print 3 color copies, duplex. Say 'confirm print' or specify changes." User replies, "Confirm print." Backend calls `execute_print`, updates status via `processing_progress`, and ends with "Print job completed" over voice plus UI toast.
3. Without leaving hands-free mode, user continues: "Scan this batch at 600 DPI to searchable PDF." Pipeline repeats (Whisper → orchestrator). Parameters resolved: intent=SCAN, dpi=600, format=pdf-searchable, multipage=true.
4. System announces, "Scanner ready at 600 DPI. Say 'add page' after each sheet or 'finish scanning' to export." User says "Add another page" twice, then "Finish scanning". Service stitches pages, runs OCR, and emits `conversion_complete` containing download URL, while voice agent confirms, "Scan saved as searchable PDF."
5. At any point user can interject "Status" to hear current step or "Cancel" to abort, ensuring full start-to-finish coverage without touch input.
